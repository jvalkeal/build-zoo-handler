# Dispatch Handler

Feature to centrally handle repository dispatches consist of a two parts,
firstly to have a workflow which acts as a central dispatch controller
listenting dispatch messages, and secondly able to send dispatch message into
a controller. Together these two features can orchestrate event based dispatch
flow starting from one workflow originating from an GitHub UI as a workflow
dispatch and ending when there is no more work to do.

Generic idea of this feature is to handle a _Release Train_ where multiple
Github projects depends on each others so that one needs to be build and
released before dependant project can build build and released. As a simple
example you have three _Spring Boot_ projects, `project1`,
`project2` and `project3` where dependency tree simply is
`project1` -> `project2` -> `project3`.
